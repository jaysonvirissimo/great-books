# Great Books
According to Wikipedia, 
"The great books are those books that are thought to constitute an essential foundation in the literature of Western culture.
Specified sets of great books typically range from 100â€“150, though they differ according to purpose and context.
For instance, some lists are built to be read by undergraduates in a college semester system, 
some are compiled to be sold as a single set of volumes, 
while some lists aim at a thorough literary criticism."


This repository consists of a collection of great book lists in a machine readable format. 
This should aid those who wish to compare such lists or to make one of their own.
